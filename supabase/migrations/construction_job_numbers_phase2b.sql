-- Phase 2b — job numbers + per-update document galleries
--
-- 1. con_documents.daily_update_id
--    Lets a daily update show its own photos/ticket without the
--    document center losing track of them.
--
-- 2. con_jobs.job_number  ->  SITE-YY  (3625-26, 210-22, CPG703-23)
--    A second project at the same site in the same year gets a
--    letter: 3625-26A, then 3625-26B. First project carries no
--    letter. Capped at 20 (A-T) per Trae's rule.
--
-- Safe to re-run. No data is dropped.
